Load all project context from processed outputs (use at start of new sessions).

Load the full project context so you understand where this Collections Risk Modeling project stands.

## What to do

1. Read `.claude/CLAUDE.md` for project purpose and domain terminology
2. List all files in `output/` and read each one
3. List all files in `data/` to know what source documents exist

## Then present a condensed briefing

After reading everything, present a concise status update:

- **Project stage**: Where are we? (early discovery / data profiling / modeling prep / etc.)
- **Documents processed**: What's been analyzed so far
- **Key findings so far**: The 3-5 most important insights across all outputs
- **Open issues**: Unresolved questions, contradictions, or gaps
- **What's next**: Suggested next actions

Keep this to ~300 words. The goal is to get Claude (and the user) oriented quickly without re-reading every document.
